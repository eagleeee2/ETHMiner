### **Building from Source**

If you prefer to compile **EthMiner** yourself, follow these steps:

#### Requirements:
1. **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher).
2. **Dependencies**: `git`, `libboost-all-dev`, `CUDA` (for NVIDIA), `OpenCL SDK` (for AMD).
3. **Supported Platforms**: Linux, macOS, and Windows (Visual Studio).

#### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eagleeee2/ETHMiner.git
    cd ETHMiner
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    - **Linux/macOS**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libboost-all-dev
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```bash
    cmake .
    make
    ```

4. Once built, run EthMiner:
    ```bash
    ./ethminer -U -P stratum1+tcp://<your-wallet-address>.<worker-name>@<pool-address>:<port>
    ```

## üéÆ Usage

### üèÅ **Quick Start**

To start mining Ethereum, execute the following command:

```bash
ethminer -U -P stratum1+tcp://<your-wallet-address>.<worker-name>@<pool-address>:<port>
```

**Replace**:
- `<your-wallet-address>`: Your **Ethereum wallet address**.
- `<worker-name>`: The name of your mining **worker**.
- `<pool-address>`: The address of your **mining pool** (e.g., `us1.ethermine.org`).

**Example**:

```bash
ethminer -U -P stratum1+tcp://0xYourWalletAddress.YourWorkerName@us1.ethermine.org:4444
```

---

### üîß **Advanced Configuration** 

- **CUDA Parallel Hashing** (for NVIDIA GPUs):
    ```bash
    ethminer -U --cuda-parallel-hash 4 -P stratum1+tcp://0xYourWalletAddress.YourWorkerName@<pool-address>:<port>
    ```

- **Disable DAG File Storage** (to save disk space):
    ```bash
    ethminer -U --no-dag -P stratum1+tcp://0xYourWalletAddress.YourWorkerName@<pool-address>:<port>
    ```

For more advanced options, use the command:

```bash
ethminer --help
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Troubleshooting**

### üö® **Common Issues**

#### 1. **Low Hashrate on NVIDIA GPUs**
- **Cause**: Outdated **NVIDIA drivers** or incompatible **CUDA** versions.
- **Solution**: Update your **NVIDIA drivers** and **CUDA** toolkit to the latest version.

#### 2. **Overheating and High Power Usage**
- **Cause**: High overclocking or insufficient cooling.
- **Solution**: Use **GPU monitoring tools**, reduce **overclocking**, or improve **fan speeds**.

#### 3. **Poor Performance with 4GB GPUs**
- **Cause**: **Ethereum‚Äôs DAG size** now exceeds 4GB, making mining inefficient.
- **Solution**: Upgrade to **6GB+ VRAM** GPUs for optimal performance.

## ‚ùì **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**1. Can I mine Ethereum with a 4GB GPU?**
- **No**, 4GB GPUs are not recommended due to the increasing DAG size. **6GB or higher** VRAM is necessary for optimal mining.

**2. What are the benefits of CUDA and OpenCL?**
- **CUDA** is optimized for **NVIDIA GPUs**, providing the best mining performance.
- **OpenCL** is used for **AMD** and **other GPUs**.

**3. Can I use **EthMiner** on macOS?**
- Yes, **EthMiner** supports **macOS**, as well as **Windows** and **Linux**.

**4. How do I check my GPU's temperature while mining?**  
- **EthMiner** provides real-time monitoring of your GPU‚Äôs temperature during mining. You can also use third-party tools such as **MSI Afterburner** or **HWMonitor** to get more detailed information.

**5. Why is my mining performance so low?**  
- Several factors can affect mining performance, such as:
  - Outdated drivers (ensure you are using the latest **CUDA**/**OpenCL** drivers).
  - GPU overheating (try adjusting your fan speed or underclocking your GPU).
  - Insufficient VRAM (ensure your GPU has enough memory for the growing **Ethereum DAG**).

**6. Can I mine other cryptocurrencies with EthMiner?**  
- Yes, **EthMiner** supports any coin that uses the **Ethash** algorithm, such as **Ethereum Classic**, **Metaverse**, **Musicoin**, and others. Just make sure you connect to the appropriate mining pool.
